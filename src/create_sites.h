/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Create_sites command before app_style set

Self-explanatory.

E: Create_sites command before simulation box is defined

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot create sites after sites already exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot create sites with undefined lattice

Must use lattice commands first to define a lattice.

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running SPPARKS to see the offending
line.

E: Create_sites region ID does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Creating a quantity application does not support

The application defines what variables it supports.  You cannot set a
variable with the create_sites command for a variable that isn't
supported.

E: Must use value option before basis option in create_sites command

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot use create_sites basis with random lattice

Self-explanatory.

E: Periodic box is not a multiple of lattice spacing

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Did not create correct number of sites

One or more created sites were not assigned to a processor
correctly.

E: Bad neighbor site ID

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Random lattice has no connectivity

The cutoff distance is likely too short.

E: Ghost site was not found

Internal SPPARKS error.  Should not occur.

E: Ghost connection was not found

Internal SPPARKS error.  Should not occur.

E: Incorrect lattice neighbor count

Internal SPPARKS error.
