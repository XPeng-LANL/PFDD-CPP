/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Label wasn't found in input script

Self-explanatory.

E: Unknown command: %s

The command is not known to LAMMPS.  Check the input script.

E: Another input script is already being processed

Cannot attempt to open a 2nd input script, when the original file is
still being processed.

E: Cannot open input script %s

Self-explanatory.

E: Unbalanced quotes in input line

No matching end double quote was found following a leading double
quote.

E: Input line quote not followed by whitespace

An end quote must be followed by whitespace.

E: Invalid variable name

Variable name used in an input script line is invalid.

E: Invalid immediate variable

Syntax of immediate value is incorrect.

E: Substitution for illegal variable

Input script line contained a variable that could not be substituted
for.

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Cannot open logfile %s

The LAMMPS log file specified in the input script cannot be opened.
Check that the path and name are correct.

E: Angle_coeff command before simulation box is defined

The angle_coeff command cannot be used before a read_data,
read_restart, or create_box command.

E: Angle_coeff command before angle_style is defined

Coefficients cannot be set in the data file or via the angle_coeff
command until an angle_style has been assigned.

command until an bond_style has been assigned.

E: Bond_coeff command when no bonds allowed

The chosen atom style does not allow for bonds to be defined.

E: Bond_style command when no bonds allowed

The chosen atom style does not allow for bonds to be defined.

E: Boundary command after simulation box is defined

The boundary command cannot be used after a read_data, read_restart,
or create_box command.

E: Box command after simulation box is defined

The box command cannot be used after a read_data, read_restart, or
create_box command.

E: Dihedral_coeff command before simulation box is defined

The dihedral_coeff command cannot be used before a read_data,
read_restart, or create_box command.

E: Dihedral_coeff command before dihedral_style is defined

Coefficients cannot be set in the data file or via the dihedral_coeff
command until an dihedral_style has been assigned.

E: Dihedral_coeff command when no dihedrals allowed

The chosen atom style does not allow for dihedrals to be defined.

E: Dihedral_style command when no dihedrals allowed

The chosen atom style does not allow for dihedrals to be defined.

E: Dimension command after simulation box is defined

The dimension command cannot be used after a read_data,
read_restart, or create_box command.

E: Improper_coeff command before simulation box is defined

The improper_coeff command cannot be used before a read_data,
read_restart, or create_box command.

E: Improper_coeff command before improper_style is defined

Coefficients cannot be set in the data file or via the improper_coeff
command until an improper_style has been assigned.

E: Improper_coeff command when no impropers allowed

The chosen atom style does not allow for impropers to be defined.

E: Improper_style command when no impropers allowed

The chosen atom style does not allow for impropers to be defined.

E: KSpace style has not yet been set

Cannot use kspace_modify command until a kspace style is set.

E: Mass command before simulation box is defined

The mass command cannot be used before a read_data, read_restart, or
create_box command.

E: Min_style command before simulation box is defined

The min_style command cannot be used before a read_data, read_restart,
or create_box command.

E: Newton bond change after simulation box is defined

The newton command cannot be used to change the newton bond value
after a read_data, read_restart, or create_box command.

E: Package command after simulation box is defined

The package command cannot be used afer a read_data, read_restart, or
create_box command.

E: Package cuda command without USER-CUDA installed

The USER-CUDA package must be installed via "make yes-user-cuda"
before LAMMPS is built.
