/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running SPPARKS to see the offending
line.

E: Lattice style does not match dimension

Self-explanatory.

E: Cannot use coloring without domain nx,ny,nz defined

UNDOCUMENTED

E: Color stencil is incommensurate with lattice size

Since coloring induces a pattern of colors, this pattern
must fit an integer number of times into a periodic lattice.
