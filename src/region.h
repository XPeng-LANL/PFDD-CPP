/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running SPPARKS to see the offending
line.

E: Use of region with undefined lattice

The lattice command must be used before defining a geometric region.
