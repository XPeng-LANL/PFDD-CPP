/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Cannot use region INF or EDGE when box does not exist

Can only define a region with these parameters after a simulation
box has been defined.

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running SPPARKS to see the offending
